This repo contains example code written in Swift to support my book; Interviewing in Swift: Algorithms and Data Structures.

# Rerequisites.

1. Xcode 7.3.1 + Swift 2.2
2. Book: Interviewing in Swift: Algorithms and Data Structures (available on Amazon for Kindle, just search for the title or my name; John Ngoi)

# Comments

As Swift continues to evolve, expect the need to refactor or migrate the code here to the version of Swift you are on.

Most of the playground names are pretty self explanatory and you can correlate it to the Chapters in the book.

For example, MyPlaygroundBFS.playground correlates to the Breadth First Search chapter.

All code have been tested and runs.
